Title: "Basic JavaScript and ES6."

It's been two full weeks already and hey those two weeks
haven't been fair. I came across challenges that I couldn't work-out,
but as a human who never allows defeat I overcame them.

The previous week I finished Basic JavaScript, which was a lot of work.
I then started with ES6 which also did give me challenges with
destructuring activities. I then did a research that kept me going.
Other than that it's been an interesting week.
