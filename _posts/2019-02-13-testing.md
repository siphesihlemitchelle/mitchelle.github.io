 # First Week At The Coding Ground.

My first week actually my two days in the crew has been a blast. Getting to meet new people with different views pertaining to Coding and learning from them, creating websites and writing blog posts as well. This has been an awesome opportunity because I now know more about Coding and that makes me more curious about the whole idea of computers. 
So, every first 30 minutes of the day, I get to do my typing practice which has improved compared to my first practice. Giving feedback on what I did yesterday and seeking for help where I get a challenge. 

 Most importantly is I learned that CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. And free code camp activities are also great, I'm enjoying each and every bit of them.
