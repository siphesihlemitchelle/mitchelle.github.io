So I have been working on JavaScript, it's challenging but the challenge
is quiet great because it encourages me to work hard and put more 
effort in my work.

#Pomodoro Timer.
I then read about the Pomodoro Timer, which is a time management method
that is used for breaking down the work into intervals,in 25 minutes in
length. This technique helps you to be more productive, keeps your mind
fresh and focused.The process isn't ideal for every person,but if you
need a systematic way to tackle your daily to do list. Definitely one 
should try it out.It sure will help in being extra productive once you
try it.
