## Javascript Strings.
On friday I learned about Javascript, that contains strings as part of the Javascript language.
Strings : Are used for storing and manipulating text. You can quote inside a string.
It has two methods: 
- indexof () : this method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a 
string/array.

This method returns -1 if the value to search for never occurs.

Note: The indexOf() method is case sensitive.

- search () : searches a string for a specified value, and returns the position of the match.

The search value can be string or a regular expression.

This method returns -1 if no match is found.
